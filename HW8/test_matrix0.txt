// Explanation of Ouput-
// Matrix class manages dynamic memory manually (via new/delete), so it must 
// correctly handle deep copies. Without a user-defined copy constructor and 
// copy assignment operator, the compiler-generated versions perform a shallow 
// copy of the pointer 'm_data', causing two Matrix objects to share the same 
// memory. When one object is destroyed, the other is left with a dangling 
// pointer, leading to undefined behavior or incorrect results.
